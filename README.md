# Unexpected `calc()` Behavior with Percentage and Fixed Widths

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically when combining percentage widths with fixed pixel values. The problem is subtle and related to how `calc()` handles relative and absolute units in dynamic contexts.

## The Problem

The core issue is that the fixed pixel addition in `calc(50% + 100px)` is computed *after* the percentage is calculated.  This means the `100px` addition is added to a percentage of the parent's width that is *potentially changing* itself.

This can lead to the element's width being slightly larger or smaller than expected, especially when dealing with dynamic content that affects the parent container's width.

## Solution

The solution often requires a more comprehensive approach, such as using viewport units (`vw`) instead of percentages or adjusting the layout strategy to avoid the combination of percentages and fixed pixel additions within the `calc()` function.
